1.	Consider the second data set (File name: TestDemo1). Data consists of blood ferritin level (dependent variable) and age (measured in months, independent variable) for 400 children un- der the age of 3 years, where the children belong to two groups (200 children in each group).

    a.	Using graphs, examine the relationship between ferritin and age for both groups, use colour to distinguish children between the two groups (include the graph in your solutions). Do you think the relationship between ferritin and age are the same (or different) for the two groups of children?

    b.	Write down a unified regression model that allows you to model the relationship between ferritin and age for both groups in one single model. Perform the analysis in R and provide interpretation of all the regression coeï¬€icients.

    c.	Formulate the hypothesis of equal slopes and provide the appro- priate test statistic along with its distribution. Perform the test in R and provide the observed test statistic along with its p-values. Are you able to reject the hypothesis of equal slopes?

    d.	Formulate the hypothesis (write down the hypothesis) of equal regression line for the two groups of children. Perform the test in R, provide the test statistic and the corresponding p-values. Are you able to reject the null hypothesis?
