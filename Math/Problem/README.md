1.	Consider the data set provided in Demo1.csv and examine the R results with respect to the pair-wise mean differences in gene expression (i.e. µi − µj).

a.	Consider the hypothesis of H0 : µ4 = µ5 against the alternative H1  : µ4	µ5.	Provide the appropriate test statistic and the corresponding distribution. Provide the observed test statistic value and the corresponding p-values (from your R results).

b.	Consider now the hypothesis of H0 : µ1 = µ2 = µ3  against the alternative H1 : µi = µj for at least one pair. Formulate the equivalent general linear hypothesis using the regression coeﬀicients, specify the appropriate test statistic along with its distribution.

c.	Using R, test the general linear hypothesis you specified in [b.], provide the error sum of squares for the restricted and full model along the corresponding degrees of freedom. Are you able to reject the null hypothesis? What is the observed test statistic and the corresponding p-value?

d.	Based on your results in [a.] and [c.], what can you say in terms of the researchers objective? are there groups of genes that are expressed the same way? Specify.
