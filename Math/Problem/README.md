1.The first data set (File name: Demo1) consists of gene expression measurements of 5 genes from 150 women with a family history of breast cancer. The objective of the study is to compare the mean gene expression profile for 5 selected genes related to breast cancer. This will allow the researcher to identify genes that are co-expressed (expressed in the same way).

    a.	Write down the appropriate linear regression model that allows you to address the study objective. Give descriptions of what the dependent and independent variables are.

    b.	Using the model you specified above, perform regression analysis in R. Provide estimates for the mean gene expression for all the five genes. Show how you get these estimates from the estimates of the regression coeﬀicients (show your calculations).

    c.	Formulate the hypothesis of equal means (H0 :  µ1  =  µ2  = µ3 = µ4 = µ5) using the regression coeﬀicients and provide the appropriate test statistic along with its distribution.

    d.	Use R to perform the test for the hypothesis in [c.] and provide the observed test statistic along with its p-value. Are you able to reject the hypothesis of equal means?
